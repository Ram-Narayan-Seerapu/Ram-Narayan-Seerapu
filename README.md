- A Web page to show the logs of test cases in graph, table and log information with color indications and error screenshots.

This is a Log web page which shows the log information of the Test case like in Robot Framework.

This Code should get the details of test case from the test executor, if not the default parameters will be considered.

Copy and execute the code. The Graph image and the log html file will be created in the same directory.

Open the log html file to view the Log details web page.
